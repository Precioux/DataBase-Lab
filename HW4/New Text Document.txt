In T-SQL, procedures and functions are two types of reusable code blocks with some key differences. 

Procedures:
- They do not have a return value and are used for performing actions like data manipulation.
- Procedures cannot be directly used in queries but are executed separately using the `EXECUTE` statement or as stored procedures.
- They can modify data in tables and databases.
- Procedures can participate in transactions and include transaction management statements.
- They can have input parameters, output parameters, or both.

Functions:
- They return a single value and are used for calculations or transformations.
- Functions can be used directly in queries, referenced in `SELECT` statements, or used within expressions.
- They are not designed to modify data and should be deterministic.
- Functions are not meant to participate in transactions directly.
- They can have input parameters but do not support output or input/output parameters.

Overall, procedures are used for performing actions and data manipulation, while functions 
are used for calculations and returning values. Procedures are more flexible in terms of data 
modification and transaction handling, while functions are suitable for use within queries and expressions.
